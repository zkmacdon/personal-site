                    Hi, my name is Zaheer! I'm a recent graduate of uOttawa, where I studied Computer Science and Statistics. Moving forward,
                    I'm interested in exploring the intersection of algorithms, probability, and psychology -- particularly in applications to health.
                    I'm especially interested in learning more about (and utilising tools/techniques from) operations research, game theory, and human factors,
                    and seeing how they manifest in and apply to multidisciplinary problems.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I'm currently taking a gap year to work on projects, engage in community work, and study some subjects which I didn't
                    have time for in undergrad. After that, I'm hoping to start grad school in 2026.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Previously I have worked in software development, and as a summer research assistant in quantum computing at uOttawa.

                        Under Professor Arthur Mehta in the Department of Mathematics, I spent the summer studying and experimenting with non-local games.
                        In particular, working alongisde a graduate student and fellow undergraduate, we explored variants of the CHSH game.
                        Some of that work looked like:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reading notes on the mathematical foundations of quantum computing and papers
                                pertaining to variants of the CHSH game. This involved learning about tensors, higher order functions,
                                and lots more — particularly in the context of quantum computing.
                            </li>
                            <li>Running 1000's of simulations of the multiplicative variants of the standard, mod-2 CHSH game as generated
                                from roots of unity. Done in Python, this required
                                the use of IBM's Qiskit library as well as numpy, sympy, and others to encode the components of the quantum circuits and run the simulations.
                            </li>
                            <li>Preparing slides to for a presentation about quantum computing for undergaduate science students. The presentation showed how
                                 the CHSH game proves the legitimacy of quantum advantage.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        It was a fantastic experience, and I'm thankful to have been exposed to higher-level mathematics and explore its applications in
                        quantum computing.

                        While an intern, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of interesting and high-impact projects.
                        Working in the manufacturing division, I was generally responsible for producing analytics and software solutions
                        to improve quality and efficiency of operations across manufacturing at CBNC.

                        Some of my projects were:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Designing and implementing a new program for production processing and product verification. This involved conducting user interviews
                                with 5-10 workers, designing a user interface that was similar to previous programs, and then running the program
                                in the plant on factory machines. (figure out how to integrate a discussion about user/occupational health & safety
                                into the mix). The backend was built in Python, and involved multithreading, networking, and computer vision -- exciting stuff!
                            </li>
                            <li> Developing a machine learning model using density-based clustering better predict machine failure. 
                                I leveraged my knowledge of metric spaces to define a custom metric specific to the dataset, and used that
                                to determine a threshold across certain parameters after which machine failure was likely.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Creating a real-time analytics dashboard with PowerBI, Python, and Azure to track and visualise sensor data. This was done
                                in order to understand which machines were going down and when, as well as how productive each station was as part of the production line. This involved
                                taking in data hourly from 100's of sensor inputs across 10's of machines.
                            </li>

                    In this project, I took the well-known Collatz conjecture from mathematics
                    and used recursion to model it. I then played around with the behaviour some more,
                    and upon visualising the behaviour of Collatz Numbers (a term I came up with 
                    to describe the number of iterations it takes for the algorithm to reach 1), I discovered the existence of "Collatz Clusters" 
                    -- consecutive numbers which share the same Collatz Number. A deeper dive into the project can be
